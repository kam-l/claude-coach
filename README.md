- **Sonnet advisor** — reads your transcript, injects session-specific coaching (⚠️ inject / ℹ️ display)
- **112 curated tips** — sourced from Boris Cherny + Anthropic team best practices
- **Prompt enrichment** — classifies ambiguous prompts via Groq, steers Claude's first action automatically
- **Two commands** — `/setup` (install, uninstall, refresh, customize) and `/verify` (adversarial escalation)
- **12 thinking lenses** — inversion, first-principles, pareto, second-order, and more

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add kam-l/claude-coach
claude plugin install claude-coach
```

**Prompt enrichment requires one of:**
- `GROQ_API_KEY` (free — [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)) — recommended
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (console.anthropic.com, per-token billing) — fallback

Set as system environment variables. Without either key, prompt enrichment is silently skipped and only spinner tips are active. The Sonnet advisor uses the `claude` CLI directly (your existing Pro/Max subscription) — no API key needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Inside Claude Code — one command for everything
/claude-coach:setup install       # first-time setup
/claude-coach:setup refresh       # re-apply tips after adding commands/skills
/claude-coach:setup customize     # list tips, add custom tips, explain plugin
/claude-coach:setup uninstall     # remove all traces

# Restart Claude Code after install/refresh/uninstall
```

## How It Works

### 🎯 Prompt enrichment (automatic)

Classifies ambiguous user prompts via Groq and routes Claude to the right workflow before it starts working:

```
User prompt → skip? (slash cmd, advisor, short) → exit
                  │ no
                  ▼
              frustration? ──yes──→ /verify (immediate, no API call)
                  │ no
                  ▼
              local gate → Groq classifier
                                │
                ┌───────┬───────┼───────┐
                ▼       ▼       ▼       ▼
             clarify   plan   recon   none
                │       │       │
                ▼       ▼       ▼
       /question  EnterPlanMode  Agent
                                (Explore)
```

| Directive | Routes to | When |
|-----------|----------|------|
| `clarify` | `question` | Ambiguous scope, missing detail |
| `frustration` | `verify` | User frustration, blame, disagreement — auto-escalates |
| `plan` | `EnterPlanMode` | 2+ files, 2+ steps, architecture |
| `recon` | `Agent (Explore)` | References unexamined code |

The local gate skips trivial prompts (short commands, confirmations, slash commands) with zero latency. Only hedging, vague, multi-sentence, or broad-scope prompts reach the classifier (~250ms via Groq free tier).

Requires `GROQ_API_KEY` (free — [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)) or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (fallback) as a system environment variable. Silently skips if neither is set.

### 🗡️ Adversarial verification

One user-facing command — `/verify` — auto-escalates based on what you point it at:

| Target type | Escalates to | What happens |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| File or artifact | `refine` | Iterative adversary loop (up to 5 rounds) |
| Claim or decision | `think` | Hegelian dialectic — attacker + defender agents |
| Quick sanity check | `challenge` | Single-pass stress-test |

### 💡 Spinner tips (always on, zero cost)

127 hand-curated tips (sourced from Boris Cherny, Anthropic team best practices, and community) rotate during tool calls. Passive reinforcement — you glance at them while waiting.

### ℹ️ Sonnet advisor (opt-in)

A detached Sonnet worker reads your session transcript and produces 1-3 tips grounded in what you're actually doing:

```
ℹ️ Run tests before committing the auth middleware changes
ℹ️ Use /fix — methodical debugging beats trial and error here
ℹ️ The retry logic in api.js needs a backoff — ask Claude to add one
```

When the advisor has *strong* advice, it's injected directly into Claude's context via `additionalContext`. Claude acts on the coaching without you having to relay it.

## Bundled Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `adversary` | Universal stress-tester — finds concrete problems with quality + analytical lenses |
| `attacker` | Antithesis advocate — builds the case AGAINST a claim (used by `/think`) |
| `defender` | Thesis advocate — builds the case FOR a claim (used by `/think`) |

## Thinking Lenses

12 analytical frameworks available via the `structured-thinking` skill:

`inversion` · `first-principles` · `second-order` · `5-whys` · `pareto` · `via-negativa` · `opportunity-cost` · `occams-razor` · `10-10-10` · `eisenhower-matrix` · `swot` · `one-thing`

Based on [taches-cc-resources/commands/consider](https://github.com/glittercowboy/taches-cc-resources/tree/main/commands/consider) by Lex Christopherson (MIT). Used automatically by the adversary agent when analyzing decisions and assumptions.

## Configuration

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_COACH": "1",
    "CLAUDE_COACH_INTERVAL": "300"
  }
}
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_COACH` | `0` | Enable Sonnet advisor + hook injection |
| `CLAUDE_COACH_INTERVAL` | `900` | Seconds between advisor cycles |
| `CLAUDE_COACH_COSTS` | `0` | Show advisor cost in statusline (`[$0.05]`) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | — | Prompt enrichment via Groq (free tier, ~250ms) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Prompt enrichment fallback via Haiku 4.5 |

Set API keys as **system environment variables**, not in settings.json.

**Advisor cost:** ~$0.10-0.18/cycle. Pro/Max users spend rate-limit budget, not dollars.
**Enrichment cost:** Free with Groq. ~$0.001/day with Anthropic Haiku.

Or run `/claude-coach:setup install` for guided setup — it wires all of this automatically.

## Tip Categories

| Category | # | Examples |
|----------|---|---------|
| Workflow | 25 | Plan mode, `/rewind`, fan-out, "choose and commit", action-explicit phrasing |
| Context | 23 | 200-line limit, `/compact` at 50%, data-at-top/query-at-bottom, quote grounding |
| Agents | 19 | Test time compute, "say use subagents", pipeline gates, curb overuse |
| Hooks | 11 | `exit 2` feedback, route permissions to Opus, Stop hook to nudge |
| Quality | 30 | Positive framing, add WHY, self-correct loops, "grill me — no PR until I pass" |
| Performance | 19 | `/sandbox` (84% fewer prompts), CI budget caps, Opus with thinking |

## User-Facing Commands

| Invocation | Type | What it does |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `/claude-coach:setup` | Skill | Install, uninstall, refresh tips, or customize |
| `/claude-coach:verify` | Command | Auto-escalating adversarial verification |

Internal (called by enrichment or `/verify` — not invoked directly):
`question`, `challenge`, `refine`, `think`
